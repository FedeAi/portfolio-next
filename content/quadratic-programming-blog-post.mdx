Quadratic Programming (QP) is a fundamental topic in the field of numerical optimization. It's a type of mathematical optimization problem where we aim to minimize (or maximize) a quadratic function subject to linear constraints. In this post, we'll explore what QP is, its applications, and common solution methods.

## What is Quadratic Programming?

A standard form of a Quadratic Programming problem can be written as:

$
\min_{x} c^T x + \frac{1}{2} x^T H x
$

subject to:

$
Ax + b = 0
$
$
Cx + d \leq 0
$

Where:
- $x$ is the vector of variables we're optimizing
- $c^T x + \frac{1}{2} x^T H x$ is the quadratic objective function
- $Ax + b = 0$ represents equality constraints
- $Cx + d \leq 0$ represents inequality constraints

A QP is convex if the matrix $H$ is positive semidefinite (i.e., $H \geq 0$). Convex QPs are particularly important because any local minimum is also a global minimum.

## Applications of Quadratic Programming

QPs arise in various fields:

1. **Finance**: Portfolio optimization
2. **Machine Learning**: Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
3. **Control Theory**: Model Predictive Control (MPC)
4. **Economics**: Resource allocation problems

## Solution Methods for Quadratic Programming

There are two main families of methods to solve QPs:

### 1. Active-Set Methods

Active-set methods follow this general strategy:

1. Choose an initial set of active inequality constraints
2. Solve the resulting KKT system with equality constraints only
3. Check if the Lagrange multipliers are positive
4. If not, adjust the active set and iterate

Here's a visualization of how an active-set method might progress:

### 2. Interior-Point Methods

Interior-point methods take a different approach:

1. Replace the non-smooth complementarity conditions with smooth nonlinear equations
2. Solve a sequence of these smooth problems, gradually approaching the original conditions

These methods generate a sequence called the "central path" that converges to the optimal solution.

        "Generally more efficient",
        "Can be less efficient due to overhead",

      [
        "Efficiency for large problems",
        "Can struggle with many constraints",
        "Highly efficient, especially with many constraints",
      ],
      [

        "Easy to warm-start",
        "More difficult to warm-start",
      ],
    ],
  }}

## Implementation in Python

Here's a simple example of how you might set up a QP problem using the `cvxpy` library in Python:

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# Problem data
P = np.array([[4, 1], [1, 2]])
q = np.array([1, 1])
G = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]])
h = np.array([1, 0.7, 0.7])

# Define and solve the CVXPY problem
x = cp.Variable(2)
prob = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize((1/2)*cp.quad_form(x, P) + q.T@x),
                 [G@x <= h])
prob.solve()

# Print result
print("status:", prob.status)
print("optimal value", prob.value)
print("optimal var", x.value)
```

## Conclusion

Quadratic Programming is a powerful tool in the optimization toolbox. Its ability to handle quadratic objectives with linear constraints makes it applicable to a wide range of real-world problems. Whether you're optimizing financial portfolios, training machine learning models, or designing control systems, understanding QP can be immensely beneficial.

As we've seen, there are different approaches to solving QPs, each with its strengths. The choice between active-set and interior-point methods often depends on the specific problem characteristics and scale.
